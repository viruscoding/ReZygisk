  INFO: When dlopen'ing a library, the system will save information of the
          opened library so a structure called soinfo, which contains another
          called solist, a list with the information of opened objects.

        Due to special handling in ptracer, however, it won't heave gaps in the
          memory of the list since we will remove the info immediatly after loading
          libzygisk.so, so that it doesn't create gaps between current module info
          and the next (soinfo).

        To do that, we use 2 functions: soinfo_free, and set_size, which will
          zero the region size, and then remove all traces of that library (libzygisk.so)
          which was previously loaded.

  INFO: When dlopen'ing a library, the system will increment 1 to a global
          counter that tracks the amount of libraries ever loaded in that process,
          the same happening in dlclose.

        This cannot directly be used to detect if ReZygisk is present, however, with
          enough data about specific environments, this can be used to detect if any
          other library (be it malicious or not) was loaded. To avoid future detections,
          we patch that value to the original value.

        To do that, we retrieve the address of both "g_module_load_counter" and "g_module
          _unload_counter" variables and force set them to the original value, based on
          the modules dlopen'ed.
